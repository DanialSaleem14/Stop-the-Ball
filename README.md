This typically includes desktop or laptop computers running compatible operating systems such as Windows or Linux. The game can be compiled and executed on these platforms using a suitable C++ development environment or compiler.

5.	Object-Oriented Design
Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles used in the game's design are:

	Encapsulation: The game's code is organized into classes, and each class encapsulates its data and behavior within itself. For example, the Game class encapsulates the game logic and state variables, such as score and lives. This encapsulation helps in managing complexity, ensuring data integrity, and providing a clear interface to interact with each class.

	Abstraction: The classes in the game's design provide abstractions by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary information and methods. For instance, the Graphics class abstracts the graphics operations, providing high-level methods to draw elements on the screen without exposing the underlying graphics library intricacies. This abstraction simplifies the usage of graphics functionality and promotes code readability.

	Inheritance: Inheritance is utilized when classes share common attributes and behaviors. In the given code, there is no explicit inheritance relationship, but the concept of inheritance can be extended if additional features or game elements are introduced. For example, if there were different types of players with varying characteristics, a Player class could be derived from a base Player class to inherit common attributes and behaviors.

	Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. While the provided code does not explicitly demonstrate polymorphism, it could be applied if there were multiple types of game elements, each with their specific behavior, but all sharing a common interface or base class.

	Modularity: The game's design is modular, dividing the code into separate classes that represent different components and responsibilities. Each class encapsulates specific functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability. For example, the Game class handles game logic, the Graphics class manages graphics operations, and the Player class controls the player's movement.

The game's design achieves modularity, reusability, and maintainability. It separates concerns, provides encapsulation and abstraction, and allows for extensibility and flexibility in adding new features or modifying existing ones.

Classes and Objects:

	Game: The Game class serves as the central component of the game. It encapsulates the game's logic, manages the game state, and controls the flow of the gameplay. It contains member variables such as rSize, rx, ry, pSize, step, px, py, score, and lives, which store information about the game's elements and current state.

	Graphics: The Graphics class handles the graphics-related operations using the graphics.h library. It initializes the graphics environment, creates and manages the game window, and provides methods to draw various elements on the screen, such as the board, reference circle, player, and text.

	Player: The Player class represents the player object in the game. It maintains the position of the player object on the screen using member variables px and py. The class provides methods to move the player object horizontally based on user input and redraws it on the screen.

Relationships between Classes and Objects
	The Game class interacts with the Graphics class to set up and manage the graphical environment. It calls the methods of the Graphics class to initialize the graphics system, create the game window, and draw various game elements on the screen.

	The Game class also interacts with the Player class to control the movement of the player object. It calls the methods of the Player class to update the player's position based on the game logic, such as keyboard input, and redraws the player on the screen.

	Additionally, the Game class utilizes the Graphics class to draw the game board, reference circle, player, score, lives, and other visual elements on the screen. It utilizes the Graphics class's methods for drawing shapes, text, and colors to provide a visual representation of the game.

	The Game class maintains the game state, including the score and lives, and updates them based on the gameplay conditions. It checks for collision detection between the player and the falling balls to determine the score and lives. It also handles the game over condition and provides a restart option.

Overall, the object-oriented design in "Stop the Ball" promotes code organization, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. Each class has its specific responsibilities, and the relationships between classes facilitate effective communication and collaboration, resulting in a well-structured and maintainable game implementation.
